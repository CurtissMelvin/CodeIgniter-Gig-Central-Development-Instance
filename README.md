# itc260-sp15-gig-central
ITC260 Spring 2015 Gig Central Project

Update 5/22/2015
I made the repo public so we could easily deploy to our development hosts

This being the case, be sure no passwords, etc. are left here

I also moved the .sql file to a folder named docs outside of the application folder

When adding to the SQL for the project, add a new SQL file there, for example: 

gig-central-05232015.sql

Thereby versioning the SQL files and preserving the older versions
